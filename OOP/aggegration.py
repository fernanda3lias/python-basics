# Relationships between classes: association, aggregation, and composition
# Aggregation is a more specialized form of association
# between two or more objects. Each object will have
# its independent lifecycle.
# It's usually a one-to-many relationship, where one
# object has one or many objects.
# The objects can live separately, but it may be
# a relationship where one object needs another
# to perform a certain task.
# (there are controversies about the definitions of aggregation).
